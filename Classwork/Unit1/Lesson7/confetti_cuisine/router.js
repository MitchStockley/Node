/*This router.js file requires the http-
status-codes and my two custom modules: contentTypes and utils.

The router module includes a routes object that holds key-value pairs mapped to GET
requests through my get function and POST requests through my post function.

The handle function is the one referred to as the callback function to 
createServer in main.js

The get and post functions take a URL and callback function and then map them to each
other in the routes object. If no route is found, I use my custom getFile function in the
utils module to respond with an error page.
